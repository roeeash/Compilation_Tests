In order to use the tester, select the appropriate file:

For example: tester for project 1 is in the folder test_folder_proj1.

2. clone the project cd test_folder_proj1

3. Enter cd test_folder_proj1, the press enter

4. read https://www.github.com/roeeash/Compilation_Tests/blob/main/test_folder_proj1/README.txt fo futher instructions.
