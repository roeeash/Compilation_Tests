# Compilation_Tests
Tests I've made for projects in my compilation course.

Tester for project 1:

Welcome to the genius tester file made by Roee Ashkenazi the great, first of his name

Before using the file:

Make sure the ex1 folder is in the following directory

/home/your-root-username/Desktop/compilation/ex1

To use this file:

1. drag the test.java file into a desired location

2. enter "javac test.java"

3. enter "java test"

4. Enter your root user name

5. Enter the path for the make command (which is /home/your-root-username/Desktop/compilation/ex1)

6. Press enter

7. it'll run test1 which comapres the outputs of the file "abcd moish 9999" to whichever output file you make.

If they're the same, the result is -1 and the tester wil print that they are the same. Otherwise, it'll print they are not the same.

Feel free to add more tests!
