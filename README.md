Testers I've written for my compilation class

In order to use the tester, select the appropriate file:

For example: tester for project 1 is in the folder test_folder_proj1.

To use tester for project 1 :

1. clone the project

2. cd test_folder_proj1

3. read [test_folder_proj1/README.txt][doc:README.txt] fo futher instructions.
